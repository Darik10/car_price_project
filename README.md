# Car Price Project
A practical project intended to predict a car prices based on given variables.
## **Project Overview:**
We are going to work on a car price peroject posted in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). I am not a Kagglist, but for me [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a place where I go to; when I need to pull some data sets to pratice with. 

I have found a data set named  [**Car Price Prediction**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction) in there, so I decided to pic the whole project and try to solve the problem out there. Let's start it.

To solve this problem I am going to follow the followig steps:-
 - 1st undrestand the problem:
   - What is the problem(research question)? and what is the bigger goal behind it (the business goal).
   
 - 2nd Write down a project proposal:
   - plan the work.
   - break down the work into milestones and smaller tasks.
   - estimate the scope for each milestone.
   - document the project proposal.
   
 - 3rd But the plan in action:
   - follow the plan.
   - make a sub-plan for each task.
   - make sure that each task is done on time.
   - plan for the next move.
   - share your work.
