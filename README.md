# Car Price Project
A practical project intended to predict a car prices based on given variables.
## **Project Overview:**
We are going to work on a car price peroject posted in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). I am not a Kagglist, but for me [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a place where I go to; when I need to pull some data sets to pratice with. 

I have found a data set named  [**Car Price Prediction**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction) in there, so I decided to pic the whole project and try to solve the problem out there. Let's start it.

To solve this problem I am going to follow the followig steps:-
 - 1st undrestand the problem:
   - What is the problem(research question)? and what is the bigger goal behind it (the business goal).
   
 - 2nd Write down a project proposal:
   - plan the work.
   - break down the work into milestones and smaller tasks.
   - estimate the scope for each milestone.
   - document the project proposal.
   
 - 3rd But the plan in action:
   - follow the plan.
   - make a sub-plan for each task.
   - make sure that each task is done on time.
   - plan for the next move.
   - share your work.

## Step1:  Undrestanding the Problem
###    Problem Descrription
As mentioned in this [Car Price Prediction Project](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction) posted on [Kaggle](kaggle.com), a Chinees automobile company named Teclov_Chinese was aspiring to enter the US market. They were planing to setup a manufactering unit in US, and to produce cars localy; to give competition to their US and European counterparts.

So they need to undrestand the factors effecting the price of cars in the US Market. 

####         Breifly
- the company wants to know:
  - Which variables are significant in  predicting the price of a car.
  - How well those variables describe the car price.


#### Business Goal
The biger idea behind this project is to model the car price variable with the other correlated/associated independent variables. So the managemnt will undrestand how different features of cars effect its price. They will use the model for deciding what designs of cars to produce inorder to meet certain price levels.

**Note:** This project was posted 4 years ago on [Kaggle](kaggle.com), but for now it is enough for me to play with it.
